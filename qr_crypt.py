### used to generate keysand sign/ verify messages
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519 

### used to convert keys (like pub key) into byte formats so they can be saved, sent, or shared
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

### exception type to catch if signature verification fails (signed message was tampered with or diff key was used)
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidSignature

### Used to generate cryptographically strong random nonce (one-time number) â€“ preventing predictable challenges.
import secrets

import qrcode
import base64
import json
import time 



# --- Step 1: Generate Key pair (this is Alice)
alice_private_key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()
alice_public_key = alice_private_key.public_key()

# --- Step 2: Save public key in a sharable form (e.g. QR)
pub_bytes = alice_public_key.public_bytes(
    encoding=serialization.Encoding.Raw,
    format=serialization.PublicFormat.Raw
)

# --- Step 3: encodes the bytes to make them readable and embedabble in JSON or QR
pub_b64 = base64.b64encode(pub_bytes).decode()

# --- Generate a challenge
nonce = secrets.token_hex(16) # one time use token
timestamp = int(time.time()) # gets current time
challenge = f"verify:{nonce}:{timestamp}" # creates challenge string that will be signed.
print(f"Challenge: {challenge}")

# --- Step 4: Alice sings the challenge
signed = alice_private_key.sign(challenge.encode)
signature_b64 = base64.b64encode(signed).decode()
# --- Step 5: Package response as a QR

payload = {
    "public_key": pub_b64, ### pub key so others can verify
    "challenge": challenge, ### original challenge so people know what was signed
    "signature": signature_b64 ### signature
}

payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

### Step 6: Create QR code
qr = qrcode.make(payload_json)
qr.show()
