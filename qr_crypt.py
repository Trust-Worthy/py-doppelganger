### used to generate keysand sign/ verify messages
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519 

### used to convert keys (like pub key) into byte formats so they can be saved, sent, or shared
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

### exception type to catch if signature verification fails (signed message was tampered with or diff key was used)
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidSignature

### Used to generate cryptographically strong random nonce (one-time number) â€“ preventing predictable challenges.

# --- Step 1: Generate Key pair (this is Alice)
private_key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()
public_key = private_key.public_key()

# --- Step 2: Save public key in a sharable form (e.g. QR)
pub_bytes = public_key.public_bytes(
    encoding=serialization.Encoding.Raw,
    format=serialization.PublicFormat.Raw
)
